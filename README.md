# Week-4-Quiz-game
# Started out with html that went very well
# css was a little more challenging. I think if I had about another week I could have finished.
# with java my tutor help me get that started.
# again I think if I had another week to work on java I could have finished.
# linking every thing to run off of the start button was the most difficult but with some help once we figured it out it went smooth.
# I only finish half but I am happy with what I learned and built.
